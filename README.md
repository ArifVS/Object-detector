# Object-detector Using Gradio and Transformers
Detect objects in images using a powerful AI model with a simple web interface.
This project is an object detection application built using Gradio, PIL, and Hugging Face's transformers library. It detects objects in images and highlights them with bounding boxes and labels.

Features
Uses facebook/detr-resnet-50 model for object detection.
Displays detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.
Easy-to-use Gradio interface.

Usage
Upload an image by clicking on the "Select Image" button.

The application will detect objects and draw bounding boxes with labels on the image.

The output image will be displayed with the detected objects.
